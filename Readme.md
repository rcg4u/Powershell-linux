# PowerShell-Linux

A collection of PowerShell implementations of common Linux commands, making Linux-style command-line operations available in PowerShell environments.

## Description

PowerShell-Linux recreates familiar Linux commands using PowerShell, providing Windows users with the comfort and functionality of Linux-style commands without leaving the PowerShell environment. Each command is implemented as a PowerShell script that mimics the behavior and options of its Linux counterpart.

## Purpose

- Bridge the gap between Linux and Windows command-line experiences
- Help Linux users feel more at home in PowerShell environments
- Provide learning resources for users transitioning between platforms
- Demonstrate the flexibility and power of PowerShell scripting

## Features

- Linux-style command syntax with PowerShell implementation
- Support for common flags and options where applicable
- Comprehensive help documentation for each command
- Cross-platform compatibility where possible

## Current Scripts

Below is a list of all currently implemented scripts in this repository:

- `wincat.ps1`
- `wincd.ps1`
- `wincp.ps1`
- `winecho.ps1`
- `winfind.ps1`
- `wingrep.ps1`
- `winhead.ps1`
- `winls.ps1`
- `winman.ps1`
- `winmkdir.ps1`
- `winmv.ps1`
- `winpwd.ps1`
- `winrm.ps1`
- `wintail.ps1`
- `wintouch.ps1`

*(Update this list as you add more scripts to the repository.)*

## Enabling PowerShell Scripts on Windows

By default, Windows restricts the execution of PowerShell scripts for security reasons. To use the commands in this project, you may need to change your execution policy:

1. **Open PowerShell as Administrator**  
   Right-click the PowerShell icon and select **Run as Administrator**.

2. **Check your current execution policy:**
   ```bash
   Get-ExecutionPolicy
   ```

3. **Set the execution policy to allow scripts:**
   ```bash
   Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
   ```
   This allows local scripts to run and requires downloaded scripts to be signed.

   - For a temporary bypass (current session only), use:
     ```bash
     Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process
     ```

4. **Unblock downloaded scripts (if needed):**
   - Right-click the `.ps1` file or folder, select **Properties**, and check **Unblock** at the bottom if present.

5. **Run your scripts as usual.**

> **Note:** Use the least permissive policy that fits your needs for better security. For more details, see the [Microsoft documentation](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=135170).

# Linux Commands in PowerShell

This project provides PowerShell equivalents of common Linux commands. Each command is implemented as a separate `.ps1` file, maintaining similar functionality to the original Linux commands while leveraging PowerShell's capabilities.

## Available Commands

| Linux Command | PowerShell Equivalent | Description                        |
|---------------|----------------------|------------------------------------|
| `ls`          | `winls.ps1`          | List directory contents            |
| `cd`          | `wincd.ps1`          | Change directory                   |
| `pwd`         | `winpwd.ps1`         | Print working directory            |
| `cat`         | `wincat.ps1`         | Display file contents              |
| `grep`        | `wingrep.ps1`        | Search text using patterns         |
| `cp`          | `wincp.ps1`          | Copy files and directories         |

| `rm`          | `winrm.ps1`          | Remove files or directories        |
| `mkdir`       | `winmkdir.ps1`       | Create directories                 |
| `touch`       | `wintouch.ps1`       | Create empty files or update timestamps |
| `echo`        | `winecho.ps1`        | Display a line of text             |
| `man`         | `winman.ps1`         | Display help for commands          |
| `find`        | `winfind.ps1`        | Search for files in a directory hierarchy |
| `head`        | `winhead.ps1`        | Output the first part of files     |
| `tail`        | `wintail.ps1`        | Output the last part of files      |

## Example: Creating Aliases in PowerShell Profile

Add the following to your PowerShell profile (`$PROFILE`):

```powershell
# Create aliases for Linux commands
Set-Alias -Name cat -Value "$repoPath\wincat.ps1"
Set-Alias -Name ls -Value "$repoPath\winls.ps1"
# Add other commands as needed
```

## Command Details and Usage
